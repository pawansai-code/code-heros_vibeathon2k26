Hey cat act as an expert fullstack developer. 
as i need to make a web application for the given scenario below 

so in the below scenario, the importance goes first to the usage of AI  but its secondary and the UI need to be more user friendly , interactive and efficient.

In real-world emergency situations such as accidents, fires, or medical crises, people often panic and are unsure which emergency service to contact—Police, Ambulance, Fire Station, or a combination of these. This confusion can cause delays in critical response time.

Your Challenge we need to tackle :

Design and develop an AI-powered web application that enables the public to report emergencies quickly, accurately, and efficiently.

Core Objective:

the website should be like where users in emergency situations can:

- Submit a detailed text description of the incident  
- Upload supporting images or videos as proof  
- Provide essential information about the situation  

Functional Requirements

Your application must:

1. Accept user inputs in the form of:
   - Text descriptions  
   - Image uploads  
   - Video uploads  

2. Use AI to automatically:
   - Analyze the input  
   - Classify the emergency into one or more categories:
     - Police  
     - Ambulance  
     - Fire Station  

3. Determine and display the severity level of the incident such as:
   - Low  
   - Medium  
   - High  
   - Critical  

4. Generate a clear, structured, and well-tuned message for the relevant emergency team(s)

5. Forward the AI-generated message instantly to the appropriate department(s)

6. Ensure that every AI-generated message includes a timestamp

This status should be visible to the user so they can track the progress of their emergency request.

Expected Deliverables

- A functional AI-powered website  
- Emergency type classification  
- Severity detection  
- Automated alert generation  
- Team status tracking system  
- Proper handling of multimedia inputs


requirements so i need to make a react js + vite based web app and with redux library for faster state management 

nnote: do develop these above task step by step with proper planing and structure with readable , reusable and structured codebases
